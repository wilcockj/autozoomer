# autozoomer
Program to auto join your classes at a given time and days of week that you meet.
In the excel file make sure you include a class name or it won't work. Add the link you
would use to join the meeting and then the time you meet in 24-hour format. The for every day that class 
meets put an x in the corresponding day of the week in the spreadsheet. I am not responsible for how you use this program and there are no guarantees it will always work.
