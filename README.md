# autozoomer
Program to auto join your classes at a given time and days of week that you meet.
In the excel file make sure you include a class name or it won't work. Add the link you
would use to join the meeting and then the time you meet in 24-hour format. The for every day that class 
meets put an x in the corresponding day of the week in the spreadsheet. I am not responsible for how you use this program and there are no guarantees it will always work. If you wish to use download all and then open zoombot.exe and edit docs/schedule.xlsx for your class meetings.

If you want to connect telegram to this to send notifications when you join and screenshots
of your desktop so you can see if the bot was successful. 
First run the script once. 

Stop the script. 

Go onto telegram message @userinfobot and copy your id into the config.ini

Once this is inputted when you start the script your telegram should get a message saying the bot has started
